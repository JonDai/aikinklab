# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive AI-driven SEO optimization system that automates keyword research, content generation, technical SEO diagnostics, and performance optimization. The system follows a four-step framework: strategic keyword analysis, content barrier construction, technical foundation optimization, and performance acceleration. The goal is to achieve rapid ranking improvements and revenue generation through intelligent automation of traditionally manual SEO processes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want an AI system to analyze my website and generate strategic keyword recommendations, so that I can focus on high-conversion opportunities without manual research tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides their website URL and business description THEN the system SHALL generate 25-50 relevant keywords categorized by intent (emergency, service, problem, local)
2. WHEN keywords are generated THEN the system SHALL prioritize keywords with high purchase intent and commercial value
3. WHEN analyzing keywords THEN the system SHALL identify "service + location" combinations for local SEO opportunities
4. IF the business has local components THEN the system SHALL generate location-specific keyword variations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want AI to generate comprehensive landing pages for each high-intent keyword, so that I can create content barriers that competitors cannot easily overcome.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a high-intent keyword is selected THEN the system SHALL create a detailed landing page with local information integration
2. WHEN generating content THEN the system SHALL include local landmarks, cultural references, and area-specific factors
3. WHEN creating pages THEN the system SHALL structure content for SEO optimization with proper headings and schema
4. WHEN multiple keywords are processed THEN the system SHALL generate unique, non-duplicate content for each page
5. IF local context exists THEN the system SHALL incorporate relevant local culture and geographic factors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website administrator, I want automated technical SEO diagnostics and fixes, so that I can resolve technical issues without manual analysis or development work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN technical SEO analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL scan the entire codebase for SEO issues
2. WHEN issues are identified THEN the system SHALL automatically fix problems including robots.txt, sitemap.xml, and schema markup
3. WHEN performance issues are detected THEN the system SHALL optimize loading speed and mobile compatibility
4. WHEN multiple issues exist THEN the system SHALL process fixes in parallel using sub-agents
5. IF critical SEO problems are found THEN the system SHALL prioritize fixes by impact on rankings

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a performance optimizer, I want AI to automatically improve website speed based on PageSpeed Insights feedback, so that I can achieve better Core Web Vitals scores without technical expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PageSpeed Insights reports are provided THEN the system SHALL analyze and implement recommended optimizations
2. WHEN image optimization is needed THEN the system SHALL convert images to WebP format and compress files
3. WHEN code optimization is required THEN the system SHALL minify CSS, JavaScript, and optimize resource loading
4. WHEN performance improvements are made THEN the system SHALL validate changes don't break functionality
5. IF performance scores are below threshold THEN the system SHALL continue optimization until targets are met

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want the system to operate with parallel processing capabilities, so that I can scale SEO operations efficiently across multiple tasks simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN complex SEO tasks are initiated THEN the system SHALL deploy multiple AI agents for parallel processing
2. WHEN content opportunities are analyzed THEN one agent SHALL focus on content while another analyzes competitors
3. WHEN technical issues are addressed THEN agents SHALL work simultaneously on different problem categories
4. WHEN multiple landing pages are needed THEN the system SHALL generate them concurrently
5. IF system resources allow THEN the system SHALL maximize parallel processing for faster completion

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a data-driven marketer, I want the system to create a feedback loop for continuous optimization, so that I can improve conversion rates based on actual performance data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages are live THEN the system SHALL monitor traffic performance metrics (CTR, conversion rates)
2. WHEN performance data is available THEN the system SHALL analyze which content structures perform best
3. WHEN optimization opportunities are identified THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust content and structure
4. WHEN A/B testing is possible THEN the system SHALL test different approaches and implement winners
5. IF conversion rates are below targets THEN the system SHALL recommend and implement content improvements
